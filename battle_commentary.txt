@ kiri / goon, goon2, goon_2, goon2_2. Kiri loses every time if alone. There truly is strength in number.

@ kiri / perd_midboss. A simple fight where Kiri can only NA or defend. If he defends from the midboss's big attack,
he wins. Else, he loses.

@ kiri, june / perd_hunter_1, perd_hunter_2, goon_1. A more typical fight in the Sixth Nest's backstreets.

@ kiri, june, lachlan / dal_riata. It's extremely hard to beat him without Emily's constant fire damage and MP
generation, so Emily joins the battle on turn 7, after Dullahan uses his big attack the first time. Takes roughly
15 turns to beat him, with everyone but Lachlan's HP at around half.
