@ kiri, june, lachlan, emily / dummy. Dummy has 1 normal attack and 5 skills that inflict a debuff each. Dummy
is the strongest.

@ kiri / goon1_1, goon2_1, goon1_2, goon2_2. Kiri loses every time if alone. There truly is strength in number.

@! kiri / perd_midboss. A simple fight where Kiri can only NA or defend. If he defends from the midboss's big attack,
he wins. Else, he loses.

@ kiri, june / perd_hunter_1, perd_hunter_2, goon1_1. A more typical fight in the Sixth Nest's backstreets.

@!! kiri, june / aubrey. It's possible to beat her while brute-forcing through her poison damage, but it's very risky.
June cannot use S3 if Kiri is defeated, while without June, Kiri can only attack with NA. Takes > 10 turns on average.

@!! kiri, june, lachlan / dal_riata. It's extremely hard to beat him without Emily's constant fire damage and MP
generation, so Emily joins the battle on turn 7, after Dullahan uses his big attack the first time. Takes roughly
15 turns to beat him with his DF down debuff. This fight also points out how OP Lachlan's self regeneration is, so I
nerfed his NA healing to 5%.

@... kiri / marcy.
