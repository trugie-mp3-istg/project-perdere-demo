            Completed a framework for ordinary attacks.
2025.8.14:  Completed Heal, Bleed, and Burn mechanics. Further balancing was made.
2025.8.15:  Completed S1 for all allies. Reorganized bits of code.
2025.8.16:  Clean-up in code regarding parameter stats.
            Added some characters in csv file.
2025.8.17:  Developed a function to insert stats automatically by searching for a character's id_num
instead of doing it manually.
2025.8.18:  No contribution other than finalizing skill names externally.
2025.8.19:  Allies can now target enemies with their skills and defend themselves.
            All characters can now "die", and a party will win if all members of the opposing party
are defeated.
2025.8.20:  Kiri and June's skill sets have been finalized with Shield_HP and temporary retreat mechanics.
2025.8.21:  Patched a few odd ends with Kiri and June's skill sets.
            Lachlan and Emily's skill sets have been finalized and patched.
            Dal Riata's gimmicks have been finalized. Further reorganization was made.
            Nerfed Lachlan's NA healing efficiency from 10% to 5%.
2025.8.22:  HP Announcing mechanic now announces HP's status effects as well.
            Developed an MP cost mechanic.
2025.8.23:  Added new enemies.
            Create a separate function for target picking, and revise text printing instances to be independent of the
attack function. Its count and mod are to be parameters. Noticeable decrease in code length is seen.
2025.8.24:  Added new enemies and 3 new status effects: poison, blindness, and fury. Fixed allies' target selection
function where it could only operate on greedily correct inputs and would crash the program otherwise.
2025.8.25:  Slightly buffed Dullahan's S4, and added a voiceline when triggering his extra attacks.
2025.9.1:   Raised MP cost of June's S1, Lachlan's S3, and Emily's S2 by 1. June's S3 now requires manual activation.
            Old burn damage logic patched, which used to deal too much damage due to miscalculations.
2025.9.2:   Lurking Beast's battle has been finished. Nerfed Lachlan's S3 healing efficiency from 50% to 40%.
            As June's S3 now requires an additional turn to use, most fights have been rebalanced around her nerf.
            Emily's S2 heal is now party-applicable, not just on herself.
2025.9.4:   Added pauses after character skills and reorganized battle codes for readability.
            Added 1 status effect: stun. By law of powerscaling, this is Dummy-upscale.
            Reworked Kiri's kit to fit a more supportive debuff role.
            Finished June's midboss fight.

2025.9.12:  Debugging and balancing. Buffed Kiri's S2.
