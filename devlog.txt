2025.8.13:  First simple prototype using 3 stats: hp, atk, df, and other damage calculation mechanics.
	    Completed a framework for ordinary attacks.
2025.8.14:  Completed Heal, Bleed, and Burn mechanics. Further balancing was made.
2025.8.15:  Completed S1 for all allies. Reorganized bits of code.
2025.8.16:  Clean-up in code regarding parameter stats.
	    Added some characters in csv file.
2025.8.17:  Developed a function to insert stats automatically by searching for a character's id_num
instead of doing it manually.
2025.8.18:  No contribution other than finalizing skill names externally.
2025.8.19:  Allies can now target enemies with their skills and defend themselves.
            All characters can now "die", and a party will win if all members of the opposing party
are defeated.
2025.8.20:  Kiri and June's skill sets have been finalized with Shield_HP and temporary retreat mechanics.
2025.8.21:  Patched a few odd ends with Kiri and June's skill sets.
            Lachlan and Emily's skill sets have been finalized and patched.
            Dal Riata's gimmicks have been finalized. Further reorganization was made.
2025.8.22:  HP Announcing mechanic now announces HP's status effects as well.
            Developed an MP cost mechanic.
2025.8.23:  Added new enemies.

            There is currently too much repetition in codes despite varying very little from each other:
codes with special gimmicks aside, most simply pick a random target, run attack, proc bleed, and print some text. The
only differences are in texts printed and 2 parameters: count and mod.
            Solution: create a separate function for target picking, and revise text printing
instances to be independent of the attack function. Its count and mod are to be parameters.
            Allies: -45 lines (including comment removal)
            Dal Riata: -12 lines
2025.8.24:  Added new enemies and 3 new status effects: poison, blindness, and fury. Fixed allies' target selection
function where it could only operate on greedily correct inputs and would crash otherwise.
            Added Marcy.
2025.8.25: Slightly buffed Dullahan's S4, and added a voiceline when triggering his extra attacks.
