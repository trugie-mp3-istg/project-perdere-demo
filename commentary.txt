@ dummy.
Dummy has 1 normal attack and 5 skills that inflict a debuff each.
Dummy is the strongest.

@ goon1_1, goon2_1, goon1_2, goon2_2: Perdor goon variants.
There truly is strength in number.

@! perd_midboss. Kiri fights this woman alone in a simple fight where he can only NA or defend.
If he defends from the midboss's big attack, he wins. Else, he loses.

@ perd_hunter_1, perd_hunter_2: Perdor enemy variants with higher stats overall.
Attacks are high-damaging but have a chance to miss.

@!! aubrey. Kiri and June team up.
The idea is to defend while stacking up on June's S2 charges until she can S3, since Aubrey's main damage output
comes from Poison. Her direct hits are low-damaging, and she does not proc Bleed on her own.
It's possible to beat her while brute-forcing through her Poison damage, but it's very risky.
June cannot use S3 if Kiri is defeated, while without June, Kiri can only attack with NA.
Takes a bit over 10 turns.

@# abno_wolf.
Designed with the participation of all 4 members in mind, especially Kiri and his S2, which is key to stopping
the big dash attack every 6 turns.
Has 3 phases, starting at 100%, 60%, and 30% HP, respectively.
1st phase is mainly a warmup exercise.
2nd phase is manageable. Party members' HP must be kept above half, as the wolf's increased SPD means higher chance
of spamming its Bleed attack, as well as proc'ing Bleed more frequently overall. Dash attack must be Kiri-S2'd or
Defended against.
3rd phase must be dealt with as quickly as possible, as its howl attack can and will throw off any strategy with
its Bleed proc'ing and Furious status effect, preventing allies from defending or healing.
Takes 20-25 turns to beat.

@!! dal_riata. Kiri, June, and Lachlan team up initially.
It's extremely hard to beat him without Emily's constant fire damage and MP generation, so Emily joins the battle on
turn 7, after Dullahan uses his big attack the first time and becomes exhausted afterward.
Dullahan uses a wide range of high-frequency skills that inflict and proc Bleed, requiring careful MP management
between healing and attacking.
Negligence of healing is punished with his big attack every 5 turns. If he successfully defeats an ally, he heals
greatly and follows up with 2 random attacks, further devastating allies' formation.
Takes roughly 20 turns.

@ kiri / marcy. Formatted like a fight, but it's just a dialogue exchange in a final encounter post-Pacifist run.
