@ kiri, june, lachlan, emily.

Kiri is not quite as formidable as his teammates combat-wise, focusing on debuffing enemies as a support role.
Note: His S1, by description, "reduces the enemy's DF by 30%." But due to damage calculation, if an enemy has negative
DF, it technically should increase it by 30% instead.

June is the designated DPS and boss-killer. She has a S1 that deals good damage, a S2 that boosts her damage to cloud
nine, and a long-winding S3 that deals guaranteed crazy damage as it ignores DF.

Lachlan is the designated tank and healer, with his naturally high HP and direct attack resistance, and 2 healing
skills. His S2 compensates for his lack of damage by sacrificing healing efficiency for greatly enhanced NA should he
need to abandon healing. Since Lachlan's sole damage output comes from his multi-hit low-damaging NA, he will struggle
quite ceremoniously against enemies with high DF.

Emily is the designated support and mook-killer. Her S1 builds burn randomly among enemies, her S2 removes all negative
status effects from an ally, and her S3 bombards enemies team-wide with just enough damage to cripple weak mooks. As
long as they don't possess high burn resistance, she can chip down HP slowly but surely, regardless of DF.

@ dummy.
Dummy has 1 normal attack and 6 skills that inflict a different debuff each.
Dummy is the strongest.


@ perd_goon_1_1, perd_goon_1_2, perd_goon_2_1, perd_goon_2_2: Weak Perdor enemy variants.
Though Kiri can't take on four people on his own. There truly is strength in number.


@! perd_midboss. Kiri fights this woman alone in a simple fight where he can only NA or defend.
If he defends from the midboss's big attack, he wins. Else, he loses.


@! june_mboss. A brutal, one-sided assault which Kiri for some reason manages to run away from after turn 2.
The real battle is actually against 2 perd_hunter and 4 perd_goon. Kiri gains passive healing and a damage buff, but
"starts" the battle with low HP.
Prioritize taking out the hunters first and foremost.
The battle results in a scripted loss once Kiri defeats the 6 Perdor mooks.
From this point forward, Kiri can use S2.


@ perd_hunter_1, perd_hunter_2: Perdor enemy variants with higher stats overall.
Attacks are high-damaging but have a chance to miss. First appearance technically from June's midboss battle.


@!! aubrey. Kiri and June team up. Aubrey's main damage output is from Poison, dealing fixed damage when the enemy
attacks.
The idea is to defend when poisoned while stacking up on June's S2 charges until she can S3, taking little damage
in the process. It's possible to beat her while brute-forcing through her Poison damage, but it's very risky.
June cannot use S3 if Kiri is defeated, while without June, Kiri can only attack with NA.
Takes a bit over 10 turns.


@# abno_wolf. Becomes more ferocious as its HP drops.
Designed with the participation of all 4 members in mind, especially Kiri and his S2, which is key to stopping
the big dash attack every 6 turns.
Has 3 phases, starting at 100%, 60%, and 30% HP, respectively.
1st phase is mainly a warmup exercise.
2nd phase is manageable. Party members' HP must be kept above half, as the wolf's increased SPD means higher chance
of spamming its Bleed attack, as well as proc'ing Bleed more frequently overall. Dash attack must be Kiri-S2'd or
Defended against.
3rd phase must be dealt with as quickly as possible, as its howl attack can and will throw off any strategy with
Bleed proc'ing and Furious status effect, preventing allies from defending or healing.
Spamming NA and Lachlan's S3 seems to work for some reason.
Takes 20-25 turns to beat.


@ sanc_fixer_0_1, sanc_fixer_0_2, sanc_fixer_0_3. A group of 3 generic Fixers in the Sanctuary, though there may be
fewer.
Kiri and June can beat 2 of them most of the time, and all 3 of them sometimes. The addition of Lachlan and Emily
makes it easier.


@ sanc_guard_a, sanc_guard_b. Robot enemies that suit better a support role, given that they're guards, not active
combatants.
Sanc Guard Model-A deals decent damage in one strike and may Stun enemies, but itself will temporarily shut down the
turn after, giving the team a chance to retaliate.
Sanc Guard Model-B deals low damage, but has heavy armor and can sustain itself with healing, as well as healing its
allies.


@!! dal_riata. Kiri, June, and Lachlan team up initially, with Emily joining from turn 8.
Dullahan has high defense and uses a wide range of high-frequency skills that inflict and proc Bleed, requiring careful
MP management between healing and attacking.
Negligence of healing is punished with his big attack every 5 turns. If he successfully defeats an ally, he heals
greatly and follows up with 2 random attacks, further devastating allies' formation.
Takes roughly 20 turns.


@!! priam. High defense, discouraging allies from attacking him directly, while summoning minions mid-fight which they
have to clear.


@ kiri / marcy. Formatted like a fight, but it's just a dialogue exchange in a final encounter post-Pacifist run.
